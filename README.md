# TwitchClipMatchFinder

This tool takes a twitch clip of someone playing dota and finds the match (match id) of dota that they were playing so you can get a dotabuff/opendota link or retrieve stats for it. I've created a reddit bot that automatically finds clips posted and gets matches for them: [/u/DotaClipMatchFinder](https://www.reddit.com/user/DotaClipMatchFinder) (The name is slightly different because TwitchClipMatchFinder was too many characters)

## How it works

- Get some info about the clip [via the twitch api](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/clips/#get-clip)
- Download the mp4 of the clip
- Extract the first frame of the mp4 (using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/))
- Find the heroes in the top bar of the image
    - First, crop the image to only look at the top row where the heroes should be
    - Load all the hero images (plus arcana images)
    - Check if the hero is in the given image and if so, where (using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/))
    - Filter out heroes that are in the wrong place in the image
    - Sort the results to get the 10 heroes that are most likely in this image in the right order
    - Do a bunch of other things to make sure we got the right heroes in the right places, because computers are bad at pattern detection
- Use [this opendota api endpoint](https://docs.opendota.com/#tag/findMatches) to search for matches containing exactly this hero matchup
- Pick the correct match out of the results based on which one has a start time closest to the time that the clip was taken


## Libraries used

- [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/clips/#get-clip)
- [Opendota API](https://docs.opendota.com/#tag/findMatches)
- [Python PIL / Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (this one requires you do `apt install python3-opencv`)

## Usage

This library was built with the idea of using it as a reddit bot, which is its main use, but it can also be used separately to find specific clips. The `find_match` function in `finder.py` can be called to find the match for a given clip slug (the 'slug' is the bit at the end of the twitch clip url that is a bunch of words together.) The finder.py file can also be started directly if you give the clip slug as the argument. Here is an example for https://clips.twitch.tv/ExuberantBillowingHumanMau5:

I've also now added support for passing in youtube urls
